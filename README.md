OpenFile
=========
This plugin allows you to open a file from the command line using the keyboard. It will tab complete your entries and allow you to navigate to any path on your system and not just files in your project. This is modeled after the emacs Ido style open mode.

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------------
To use this you should bind the `text_open_file` command to a keyboard shortcut that you want.
